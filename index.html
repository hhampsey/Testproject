        <h4> How I got into Gardening </h4> 
            <p> Gardening is something that has always been an interest in my family.  No one in my 
                family had a "Green Thumb" or anything, but my family always appreciated the beauty of 
                flowers.  We may have dabbled in growing vegetables and herbs, but our main focus was always
                flowers.  Any time someone hears "I enjoy gardening" people assume I have a little vegetable
                garden or herb garden.  Just flowers...</p> 
            <p> I got into gardening when I was older and in college.  My grandma and mom had always enjoyed
                flowers and one day I was helping them out with planting flowers and realized how relaxing 
                it is. Everyone talks about how important it is to be mindful, to be IN the moment.  No one 
                really talks about how easy it can be to be mindful or IN the moment when you truly are 
                interested in what you’re doing and enjoying the company around you.  What makes mindfulness
                difficult is trying to force ourselves to engage in something that we are just not interested
                in.  For me, Gardening is a great way to relax and enjoy nature. It allows me to connect with 
                the earth.  I never had large plots of land where I planted flowers, most of the time, they 
                were window sill pots and flowerpots I found at random garage sales.  That’s the nice thing 
                about flowers; they look beautiful wherever you put them.  As long as you take care of them, 
                they will continue to look beautiful until they die.

            Movement of the body is important for everyone.  Gardening is a great way to get exercise without even realizing it.  You are moving your arms, legs, and back while you are digging in the dirt, planting flowers, and watering them.  It’s a great way to get exercise without even realizing it.

            Gardening is a great way to relieve stress.  It allows you to be in the moment and focus on 
            something other than your worries.

            Gardening can be a great way to connect with others.  You can join a gardening club or 
            just talk to your friends and family about it.  It's a great way to bond with others and 
            share your love of flowers. However, personally it has brought me closer to my mom by 
            going flower shopping together. It brought me closer to my fiancee's best friend as he is a 
            landscaper and has helped me navigate my garden; even helping out with the heavy lifting!
